Bitcoinium... 


Building
===============
TODO clean this up.
To build Bitcoinium I use Eclipse with ADT (Android Development Tools) plugin. I also use the GraphView library as I mentioned to you before and the Sherlock ActionBar library which enables UI features from Android 3.0+ on Android 1.6+ (no need to rewrite interface for different versions of Android). Once all that is set up you can build it and copy the APK over to a device to be installed. The app will need to be signed for it to be released on Google Play though. Feel free to contact me if you need help setting up the environment, the Sherlock library was kind of tricky to get working.
